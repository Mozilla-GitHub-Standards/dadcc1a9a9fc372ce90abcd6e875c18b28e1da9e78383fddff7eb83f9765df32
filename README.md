Code as a research object
====================

Project between Git(Hub), figshare and the Mozilla Science Lab. 

What this does
--------------

This is a proof of concept integration between a GitHub repo and Figshare to explore a way to better integrate code and scientific software into the scholarly workflow. The project will test building a bridge that will allow users to push code from their GitHub repository to figshare, providing a Digital Object Identifier for the code as a research object.
